				<img src="images/Allegri_MG1_9258.jpg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>Juventus have received just one point in their last two league matches, but with Sunday's upcoming match against Udinese have a chance to pick up points on the two teams ahead of them, who are facing off head-to-head this week. Coach Massimiliano Allegri gave his thoughts in his press conference ahead of the match: "Both Napoli and Inter cannot afford to lose, so I predict a draw. But we must win. Napoli this year have confirmed themselves, their team has grown a lot and also in Europe: they played a great match against City and they can compete with the big teams in Europe. Spalletti is a great coach, they are solid and they have won while giving up not many goals, pus they have offensive power. Dybala? On Thursday he had a small bout with the flu after his return from the international break, then played a half against Lazio. He is fine now. Away from the pitch he has character and know how to handle whatever happens to him, he his very calm and is okay physically. Tomorrow he will play. Rugani? He will play tomorrow, my decision is based on what I see in training. There were matches where it was better to play Barzagli, Chiellini, or Benatia, all top players. Udine is always unique because we always seem to be playing them in a delicate moment, which it is for them too. We'll have to be very aware, because we will want to collect the points."</p> -->

				<img src="images/21730032_10212357514686689_287806719_o.jpg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>After the impressive display against Chelsea, Roma are traveling to Turin to face Sinisa Mihajlovic’s squad. In the pre match press conference the giallorossi’s manager Eusebio Di Francesco spoke about some of his individual players:”Schick will likely be selected, even though he obviously isn’t in peak form. De Rossi and Gonalons? They are different players but for me they are starters, I’ll alternate them based on the match. Aguanst Chelsea the Frenchman played because I saw him do very well. Moreno? In one of these matches he could start. I believe that to have a match like the one against Chelsea you need a lot of courage. I like to see my team attack the opponent in their half. Tomorrow’s match will be very difficult because we are coming off a difficult away match an Torino is a great team”</p> -->

				<h3>Boateng: "I dream about Ancelotti turning back to Milan. I could have played for Inter but I'm a rossonero!"</h3>
				<img src="images/Boateng_Di_Marzio.jpeg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>From his farewell to Las Palmas - "A duty as a father and husband" - to his love for Milan, both the club and city: "My three years at Milan are worth ten". Kevin-Prince Boateng works now, not only as a football player, but also to "help the youngsters to become men" with an important fight: "Racism? I'd like my son to grow without knowing this word". To La Gazzetta dello Sport, the midfielder has started from there: "What would I suggest? An ad-hoc VAR for the racists in the stadiums. There are a thousand cameras, also directed towards the fans, why not using some of these for that? Who makes a mistake, pays for it. For the players playing abroad, Serie A could be an objective, but the racism limits its appeal. We shouldn't get surprised they choose to go elsewhere". It was hard, to leave Las Palmas last summer: "Leaving has been the toughest decision I've made after the goodbye to Milan. There was everything, a young group and a fantastic atmosphere. I'll stay here at Eintracht for three years, like my contract tells". "Ancelotti? What a shock... I'm sorry, but there seems to always be a first time. He'll get back" tells the former Milan player that dreams to see Carletto again on Milan's bench: "What a dream, they couldn't have a better coach. Montella? In some clubs, where you need to win, the bench becomes a "warm place" before you even sign. They fired Allegri years ago... It's part of the game, for everyone of us". In the meantime, there have been encouraging signs during the derby: "Against AEK it didn't go well but I've seen a good Milan against Inter. Icardi unfortunately plays on the other side, he's one of the best in the world. Bonucci, Gigio and Suso are the only ones able to make a difference. I don't see a lot of grant though".About Leo Bonucci, Boateng says: "At Turin there were many champions, he's now the leader at Milan and there could be some difficulties. He'll show with the time he's still one of the best, I'm sure about it". The real problem of this Milan is the absence of people like Berlusconi and Galliani: "They've made history, Maldini Kakà and other have made it on the pitch. Legends, but they're not there anymore! We must support this ownership and the players. I was satisfied about the mercato but there was so many names! It's been a problem. People have talked so much about Aubameyang, one of the best in Europe. It's normal to remain disappointed". About a mercato memory on the cousins from Inter: "It's true, they've looked for me but there only was Milan for me. I could also have chosen other teams, not only Inter. I'm a man of my word though". A comment on his future: "What will I do in ten years? I hope to be a great agent, that puts the person's interests ahead. I've missed that until I met Eduardo, my current agent. I'd like to be an exemple for the youngsters".</p> -->

				<h3>Psg, Verratti: "I didn't stay for the money. Some teams would have spent 100m for me..."</h3>
				<img src="images/Verratti_DAN0277.jpg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>In an interview to L'Equipe, Marco Verratti has talked about the mercato rumors about a move last summer: "To be honest, I've been asked to stay here for the first time since I'm here. They've reassured me about the project and ambitions, winning something with Psg will always be different than with another team, I'm very well here". Temptation to leave for Barcelona?: "Last season we had some difficult times, we had to face teams that were more like a team than we were. Critics are usual here, we've got big wages and for that reason expectations are higher: look at Ranieri's Leicester though, things don't always go as planned... Anyway, I didn't expect to live a summer like this one, I didn't like a lot of things that happened especially the behavior of some people on my side that have thought about themselves and not about me. It's not true I told the club I wanted to leave". The receiver of these words? Probably his former agent Di Campli: "He put in my mouth words I've never said without asking my consent. I hope one day we'll have a good relationship again, but in these circonstances I had to get far from him. Raiola (his new agent)? I'm fine with him, Ibrahimovic has advised me to go with him". "When the new sportive director Antero Henrique got here, I turned back from holiday to understand how things would go. After the first meeting I already told him I would stay, even before the signings of Neymar and Mbappé; I didn't know at the time they would sign". It's not true that "Il Gufetto" has chosen to stay for economic advantages: "People think that I play at PSG for the money but they're wrong. Last summer some teams would have spent 100M to have me, and they would have offered me bigger wages. Neymar would have also won more at Man City or at Chelsea but signed for PSG: the club's project has convinced him, like it convinced me". Marco enjoys his new teammates now: "Mbappé is phenomenal, Dani Alves has a winning mentality".</p> -->

				<h3>Milan, Fassone: "Montella-Mirabelli? We're all on the same side. Without Champions League 1-2 top players would leave"</h3>
				<img src="images/Schermata_2017-06-03_alle_18.06.03.png" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>"No one would have thought that with a squad that has changed so much there wouldn't be some problems, but we sure are behind what we planned from 5-6 points". Clear words, that are said to calm the critics though. Marco Fassone has decided to make order between all the voices about Milan to La Stampa: "The objective was to compete for the fourth spot for the first part of the year and then try to get higher in the Champions League zone in the second part. It's clear there are possibilities to go higher but we can't miss chances again". At the moment, Montella's job isn't at risk then: "We chose him and he's got all of our trust. What would happen if he lost another game? We shouldn't think about what could happen but all work in the same direction to step out of this moment. I'm convinced we'll do it". About Mirabelli's words: "It's not a pressure matter, Milan have been built to get some results: they aren't getting them and we have to be transparent with our fans. Montella-Mirabelli? We all are on the same side". About Bonucci: "There are people that are happy when you give them less responsibilities and other that were born to have some. Bonucci is one of those in the second category. It's true, he's not playing at his value. He also pays the general situation". About the "obligation" to get qualified for the Champions League: "People should ease up with the "obligation" word. The Champions League is fundamental for our project but missing it wouldn't block our plans. We'll delay them for one year and will find the system so than we can balance the missed income with the sale of one or two top players". From the pitch to the economic matters, with a comment on the Eliott debt: "The project, speaking about what regards Milan, is to have it done in advance in spring. We've got variate options that are being valued with attention. Yonghong Li? This skepticism is annoying, if we were in England no one would care. I'll only say that the owners have made a €49m increase in the budget and there isn't loaned money to AC Milan. The objective is on a three-year basis, increasing the incomes and then getting active on the stock market at Hong Kong. There are three legs a club stands on, the TV rights, the stadium incomes and the merchandising. We have a fourth one with the work on the Chinese territory. Financial Fair Play? Everything is now clearer than it was in July, we're confident".</p> -->

				<h3>Roma, Fazio: "We played a great match against Chelsea even though we didn't win"</h3>
				<img src="images/Federico_Fazio.jpg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>After Roma's draw against Chelsea in the Champions League, leaving the giallorossi in a possible position to move on to the knockout rounds, defender Federico Fazio spoke exclusively with Sky Sport. "It's a shame we didn't win against Chelsea but we have an important match ahead now. We need to play the same way in the league too. We are learning how to play together, when Di Francesco arrived he tried to make us understand right away what he wanted from us and to understand what we could give him. It's true we haven't won against the big teams in the league while in Europe we have secured draws, but I don't think we are focused on Europe because against Inter we played a great game and we could have won. Against Napoli at home we played a good second half and a draw there would have been deserved. It didn't happen, it's too bad because we didn't fare well in those two matches while against Atletico and Chelsea, who are experienced in Europe, we showed we could play a great match even though we didn't win. Argentina's World Cup qualifier against Ecuador? We were a little scared wen we conceded a goal in the first minute, then Messi set us back right, making it look so easy. Leo always plays like that and has for 15 years, he is one of the best in the world."</p> -->

				<h3>Inter, probable lineup against Napoli</h3>
				<img src="images/perisic.jpg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>Tomorrow marks a huge test for Inter, who will be traveling to Naples to face Napoli in a top of the table clash. They will be looking for a great performance and one to show that they are for real in the chase for the scudetto. The nerazzurri are coming off a derby win against Milan and Luciano Spalletti will probably send them out in their familiar 4-2-3-1 formation. Here is the probable lineup:
				
				Inter: Handanovic; D'Ambrosio, Skriniar, Miranda, Nagatomo; Gagliardini, Vecino; Candreva, Borja Valero, Perisic; Icardi</p> -->

				<img src="images/Benatia_MG1_1900.jpg" alt=image>
				<!-- <p>After squeaking out a win in the Champions League against Sporting, Juventus will return to action on Sunday at 6pm local time away to Udinese. They will be looking to get back on the right track in the league after last week's loss to Lazio. Here is the report from today on their official site, including injury updates: "This morning the bianconeri worked on tactics, after warming up and a series of technical and possession based drills, they worked on the movements they will replicate in the match on Sunday in Friuli. Claudio Marchisio took part in the whole session, meanwhile Stefano Sturaro did not train, due to a knock to his left thigh muscle during the Champions League match, and neither did Medhi Benatia, due to the hard knock to his right ankle suffered against Sporting. Marko Pjaca and Mattia De Sciglio have taken part in some of the group training, while Benedikt Howedes took part in an individualized training program."</p> -->
