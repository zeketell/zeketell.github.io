			<p>Juventus have received just one point in their last two league matches, but with Sunday's upcoming match against Udinese have a chance to pick up points on the two teams ahead of them, who are facing off head-to-head this week. Coach Massimiliano Allegri gave his thoughts in his press conference ahead of the match: "Both Napoli and Inter cannot afford to lose, so I predict a draw. But we must win. Napoli this year have confirmed themselves, their team has grown a lot and also in Europe: they played a great match against City and they can compete with the big teams in Europe. Spalletti is a great coach, they are solid and they have won while giving up not many goals, pus they have offensive power. Dybala? On Thursday he had a small bout with the flu after his return from the international break, then played a half against Lazio. He is fine now. Away from the pitch he has character and know how to handle whatever happens to him, he his very calm and is okay physically. Tomorrow he will play. Rugani? He will play tomorrow, my decision is based on what I see in training. There were matches where it was better to play Barzagli, Chiellini, or Benatia, all top players. Udine is always unique because we always seem to be playing them in a delicate moment, which it is for them too. We'll have to be very aware, because we will want to collect the points."</p>
